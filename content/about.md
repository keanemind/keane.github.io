### ME
I am a freshman majoring in computer engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. Ever since I learned to walk, I have been unable to keep myself from meddling with electronics and computers. Now, I plan on earning an undergraduate degree as I explore which aspects of engineering I enjoy most.

### THIS SITE
This website was generated by the Hugo static site generator using the Cocoa-EH theme (slightly modified by me). It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/keanemind/keanemind.github.io) and I have it set up to be [automatically deployed](/blog/automated-deployment/) there.

In the coming months, I plan to learn enough CSS to be able to further tweak the aesthetics of the pages here. 
Here are some things about this theme that I am currently unsatisfied with:

1. The way the website's header shifts up and down when viewed from a desktop computer, depending on what page visitors are viewing. 

2. The website is a bit too minimalistic. 

3. I'm pretty sure now that the header shifts left and right a little too. 

4. I don't want the copyright text at the bottom of the site to be a link. Removing the \<a> tag caused its formatting to be different though, and I don't know why.

I will deal with all these shortcomings eventually.
