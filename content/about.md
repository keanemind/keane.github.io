### ME
I am a high school senior attending the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science at the University of North Texas. Ever since I learned to walk, I have been unable to keep myself from meddling with electronics and computers. Now, I plan to earn an undergraduate degree in computer engineering or computer science. 

### THIS SITE
This website was generated by the Hugo static site generator using the Cocoa-EH theme (slightly modified by me). It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/keanemind/keanemind.github.io) and I have it set up to be [automatically deployed](/blog/automated-deployment/) there.

In the coming months, I plan to learn enough CSS to be able to further tweak the aesthetics of the pages here. 
Here are some things about this theme that I am currently unsatisfied with:

1\. The way the website's header shifts up and down when viewed from a desktop computer, depending on what page visitors are viewing. 

2\. The website is a bit too minimalistic. 

3\. It seems that this theme does not support numbered lists, only bulleted lists. Typing "1." creates a bullet. 

4\. I'm pretty sure now that the header shifts left and right a little too. 

5\. I don't want the copyright text at the bottom of the site to be a link. Removing the \<a> tag caused its formatting to be different though, and I don't know why.

I will deal with all these shortcomings eventually.
