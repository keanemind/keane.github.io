I am a high school senior attending the Texas Academy of Mathematics and Science at the University of North Texas. Ever since I learned to walk, I have been unable to keep myself from meddling with electronics and computers. Now, I plan to earn an undergraduate degree in computer engineering or computer science. 

This website was generated by the Hugo static site generator using the Cocoa-EH theme (slightly modified by me). It is hosted on [Github Pages](https://github.com/keanemind/keanemind.github.io). 

In the coming months, I plan to learn enough CSS to be able to further tweak the aesthetics of the pages here. I am currently unsatisfied with the way the website's header shifts up and down when viewed from a desktop computer, depending on what page visitors are viewing. I also think that the website is a little too plain. In time, I will address both of these shortcomings.
