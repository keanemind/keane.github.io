Well. It really has been a long time since I last posted on my blog. It's been so long that my [About Me](/about) page is out of date! Let me explain what happened. 

I stopped posting because finals were approaching and I dropped everything to focus on school. After I graduated, I forgot all about the blog. I was already feverishly working on my latest project: a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) bot for my Discord server!

You see, I run a Discord server called Pirate Ship for my friends and their friends to use when we're gaming. When summer started, I set up a bot called [Red](https://github.com/Twentysix26/Red-DiscordBot) on a [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplet. On my server, the bot is named Parrot. What I've been doing all summer is coding [a module for him](https://github.com/keanemind/Keane-Cogs). 

I've created a command that allows people to "!feed" him at the expense of credits, a virtual currency tracked by the bot. Feeding Parrot gives users a chance to be chosen by Parrot as his perch. Whoever Parrot perches on gets special commands and abilities for the games that you can play through Parrot bot. 

Eventually, I want to expand the functionality of my !feed command and code other commands such as a League of Legends stats function. Before I do that, however, I really need to start documenting what I've written so far. The code and its comments are messy, and I don't have documentation for any of the commands on the GitHub wiki. 

In other news, I have been applying to hackathons and doing [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). I hope I can learn enough HTML and CSS from Free Code Camp to be able to fix some of the issues with this website that I have listed on the About Me page. I'm also really looking forward to learning Javascript. 

And about my [objective update 1](/blog/objective-update-1) goals: I have not touched any Timus Online Judge problems in a long time, and my mom's old laptop was too loud to use. For now, it looks like I will not be able to use a Linux computer. 

Finally, I really need to make posting on here a habit. I want to practice writing, so I will try to keep this blog updated about what I'm working on and my progress over time. I've been reading Sherlock Holmes short stories again. I think I'll analyze the way Arthur Conan Doyle writes, and see if I can learn to piece my sentences together the way he does.
