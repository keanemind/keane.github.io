Hello, world! This is my first post on this website. This is certainly not the first website I've ever created or hosted, but I do hope that this will be the longest running site I've made yet. 

My goal is for this blog to be a journal and portfolio of my technological endeavors as I go through the process of becoming a better coder and creator.

As of now, I intend to keep this blog completely focused on tech; I will not chronicle other aspects of my life here.
