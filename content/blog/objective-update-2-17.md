The way this is going to work is that I'm going to keep a status update on this blog about what my current short-term objectives are. 

I have two objectives for the next few months:

The first is becoming proficient in Python. I am using the book "Dive into Python 3" to learn the basics at the moment. I need to come up with simple program ideas that I can implement with Python to practice as I go. I can practice with online problem sets or programming games and competitions. Right now, I have a [Github repository](https://github.com/keanemind/TimusOnlineJudge) containing my solutions to some (very easy) [Timus Online Judge](http://acm.timus.ru/) problems. I am not interested in competing on the website though, so I will not register on the website or submit any of my programs. I'm not trying to learn optimization or anything; I just need to practice basic programming. 

The second is getting used to using Linux. I am receiving an old laptop from my mom this weekend. I'm going to install Ubuntu on it and start using it regularly. I need to get used to using the Linux terminal and navigating the Linux filesystem if I want to be able to manage a Linux server in the future.
